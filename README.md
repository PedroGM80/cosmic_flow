🌌 Cosmic Flow

A visually captivating Android app featuring dynamic particle effects, fluid metaballs, and interactive touch ripples — powered by Jetpack Compose and AGSL shaders.

Cosmic Flow explores advanced graphics techniques on Android, combining the flexibility of Jetpack Compose with the performance of AGSL (Android Graphics Shading Language) to create immersive, fluid, and futuristic visuals.

✨ Features

🎇 Dynamic Particle Field – A responsive field of particles flowing through a noise field and reacting to touch, resulting in organic motion.

🔮 Metaballs Background – A smooth, lava-lamp-style animation rendered with custom AGSL shaders.

🌊 Spectacular Touch Ripples – Multi-layer ripple effects with sparkles and distortions triggered on screen taps.

🎭 Interactive Title Screen – A subtle tilting title with a reactive spotlight effect that follows user input.

🕹️ Controls Overlay – A lightweight UI layer for tweaking parameters or displaying information.

🌈 Fallback Gradient Background – Ensures a pleasing animated gradient on devices without AGSL support.

⚙️ Customizable Components – Colors, speeds, intensities, and counts are all externalized for easy experimentation.
